# To-Do List

## This project is a convienient way to input a task and track the progress of the tasks. 
This project has an input where you select a category, type in what the task is, and due date for it.
After clicking submit, the task populates below with the other tasks needing to be complete. 
When the task is completed, the user can check the task off the list. Styling is used to let the user know that it is completed,
and after the task is no longer relevant, the user can remove the task completely by clicking the red 'x'.
